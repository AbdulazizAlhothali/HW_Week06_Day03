- This assignment will be the beginning of HTTP requests and JSON parsing. Thus, you need to do the following things to prepare your assignment for the next steps:
    1. `Recyclerview` where each item has `three TextViews` and `two ImageViews`.
    2. ViewModel and LiveData.
    3. Coroutine.
    4. Create a data class called `YouTubeVideo` that has attributes (Id:Int, Title:String, numberOfViewers:Int).
    5. create dummy data of `YouTubeVideo` class that will display to Recyclerview.
